## Design

The interface follows the [xahau.network](https://xahau.network) design system, so the
course reads as part of the Xahau family rather than a separate product:

- **Canvas** `#f7f7f7`, white editorial cards at `24px` radius with a soft lifted shadow
- **Type** Onest for everything, `ui-monospace` for micro-labels, chips and counters
- **Accent** Xahau green (`#007a28` on light, `#5de48c` on dark) with a teal secondary
- **Modules** cycle through four brand tints — green, teal, sand, sage
- **Buttons** `6px` radius, never pills

Shared primitives (`.x-card`, `.x-btn`, `.x-chip`, `.x-act-label`) and the token set live in
`src/styles/index.css`; the wordmark lockup, icon set and module themes live in
`src/components/Brand.jsx`. Light is the default; a dark counterpart built on the brand's
`#0f2328` ink is available from the header toggle.

## Deployment

`site.config.js` holds `SITE_URL`, by default
`https://learn.xahau.network/xahau-course`. Everything that depends on the
host is derived from it at build time, and nothing else hardcodes it:

| Derived | Where |
|---|---|
| Canonical link, Open Graph and Twitter image URLs | `index.html`, via `vite.config.js` |
| Vite's `base` (the sub-path assets are served from) | `vite.config.js` |
| `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` | `scripts/build-course-data.mjs` |
| `public/CNAME` | `scripts/build-course-data.mjs` |

### Moving the site

- **For one build**, set the variable: `SITE_URL=https://example.org npm run build`.
- **For every GitHub Pages deploy**, set a repository variable `SITE_URL`
  (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables). The deploy
  workflow passes it to the build; left unset, the default applies.
- **For good**, change the default in `site.config.js`.

`public/CNAME` is generated, never committed. It is written only when the
site sits at the root of a domain of its own (for example
`https://learnxahau.inftf.org`), and removed otherwise: on a sub-path the
domain belongs to the Pages site that serves its root, and a *.github.io URL
needs none. On a sub-path, `robots.txt` is only honoured if the host's root
serves it, so list this course's `sitemap.xml` there.

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is manual-trigger only until someone confirms
GitHub Pages is the right target.

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- No backend required — all content is static JS modules

## How the course data loads

The twelve modules total roughly 3 MB. Importing them all up front meant every
visitor downloaded the entire curriculum before the index page painted, so the
data is split in three:

| Artefact | Generated | Loaded |
|---|---|---|
| `src/data/generated/manifest.js` | at build | bundled — module and lesson titles, so the overview renders instantly |
| `src/data/modules/*.js` | hand-written | one dynamic `import()` per module, on open (next module prefetched) |
| `public/search/<lang>.json` | at build | fetched the first time search opens |

`npm run prebuild` (and `predev`) runs `scripts/build-course-data.mjs`, which
writes the manifest, the per-language search indexes and `public/sitemap.xml`.
Never edit `src/data/generated/` by hand.

Result: the index page loads one ~100 KB script instead of 3.1 MB.

## Adding a module

1. Create `src/data/modules/mXX-your-slug.js` (copy `_template.js`)
2. Register the filename in `src/data/module-list.js`
3. Add a line icon for its `id` to `ICON_PATHS` in `src/components/Brand.jsx`
4. Optionally add `src/data/quizzes/<module id>.js` for an end-of-module check.
   Questions must be answerable from that module's own lesson text — the point
   is to check comprehension, not to introduce new material.

`npm run dev` regenerates everything derived.
